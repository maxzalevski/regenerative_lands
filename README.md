**What ecosystem restoration looks like. Regenerative Ecovillages 🌾🐝**

Here are some archival photos from 20 years ago from the ecovillage of Kedry Polissia in Ukraine. How the process of regeneration of degraded land, abandoned collective farm fields takes place. When ecovillagers come there.

Of course, it is difficult to convey all the beauty and scale in one photo. Without shooting from a drone, for example, the same 50 hectares of area. But you probably get the idea. 

A field was burned down and now there is a blooming forest.

🌱 Soil restoration

First, there is the restoration of biomass, as one settler told me, which sometimes takes 5-10 years. 

Because when you enter such a field, there is nothing but sand. I can't even imagine how difficult it was to live in such conditions. Some families were living in the pits. I'll post a photo in the comments.

Thousands of seedlings are planted every year. No more than 3-5% of them survive. Near each settler's house you will find a nursery of new tree and shrub seedlings. Every season you can visit a new tree planting. 

🍃 Biochar and composting

The soil is also cultivated through constant composting of organic matter and burning branches after pruning. All of them go into the soil and beds. 

The fallen leaves and needles form their own ecosystem and so, layer by layer, a thin layer of soil is formed over the years, on which the May cover is carefully broken/seeded.
Gradually, the groundwater is pulled up.

💦 Lakes

I must finally admit that Holzer did revolutionize our settlements by digging those lakes wherever he went. Because with them, oases of life, flora and fauna came here to these dead degraded fields.

Pit lakes, as they are called here, are described in Anastasia's ideas as a necessary component of the estate. They form dumps or berms. These are windbreaks that allow seedlings to grow faster. 

Of course, anyone who knows the subject knows that trees grow better when they are planted in close strips and given a windbreak. Then, of course, watering and pollination 

🐝 Bees and insect farms

Borti, logs, insect houses, it never ceases to amaze me how intensely and creatively these pioneer settlers approached the cultivation of natural local pollinators.
The ecosystem can't do without them. 
And interestingly, the search moved towards the achievements of the past, not the importation of some exotic species. 

They were looking for local Polissya or steppe bees, osmia bees, ladybugs, earwigs, and all possible insects 🐞 🦟 

The logs do not produce much honey - this is primarily an ideological step, all for the restoration of ecosystems. 
And they are recovering, albeit so slowly and so many times they have to do it all over again...

🌳 Growing a man-made edible forest in the middle of a field is extremely difficult.
